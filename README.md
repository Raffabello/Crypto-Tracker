I created this project for learning purposes, and I employed the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/api">Gecko API</a> to pull the token market data.

# What it can do
- Tracks the prices of the top five cryptocurrencies.
- Offers a simple plot that shows the prices variation
- Supports USD and EUR currencies
